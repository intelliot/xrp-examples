# XRP Examples

Experiments with the XRP Ledger

## Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - v8 LTS is recommended, but other versions may work.
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install) dependency manager.

## Usage

```
yarn install
yarn compile
node .
```

Note that you should use `yarn` (not `npm`) due to way it handles `git+ssh` urls for dependencies.
